                The Section 179 tax deduction has been extended for 2021. This
                bill allows for a full deduction of equipment up to $500,000,
                which makes it advantageous to purchase new or used equipment
                for your business. Have your accountant or CPA use Form 4562.

                Good credit is obviously an important piece to qualifying for a
                loan, but is only one of many factors lenders will look at.
                Approval, as well as rates for a loan or lease, will be
                determined by time in business, homeownership, type of business,
                how many guarantors on the loan, history of like-size loans in
                the past, etc.

              <p>
                An Equipment Finance Agreement is a very popular financing
                option. Although it works “like a lease”, it is technically not
                a lease. With an EFA, the borrower owns the property and it is
                secured by a UCC filing or a title. This means that only the
                equipment is the collateral versus an installment loan that can
                have a blanket lien on all of your business assets. There are
                numerous other benefits of an EFA as well.

                What is a collateral loan?
              </summary>
              <p>
                A collateral loan is when other lien-free equipment is used as
                collateral to secure the new financing. Typically, a lender will
                want a 2:1 ratio, which means if $30,000 was desired to purchase
                a piece of equipment, an additional $30,000 in equipment would
                be needed to put up as collateral. This type of financing is
                often used when credit challenges exist.

                Does a bankruptcy disqualify me?
              </summary>
              <p>
                If a bankruptcy is not “discharged”, then credit will not be
                available. After discharge, different lenders will consider
                offering loans after 2 – 5 years. A significant parameter will
                be how much credit has been established since the bankruptcy.
                Non-conventional financing options do exist upon bankruptcy
                discharge.

                What is a soft credit pull?
              </summary>
              <p>
                All potential lenders will do a credit check on a potential
                borrower, but some lenders will only do a “soft” pull. This is
                when public data is pulled but not through a credit agency. Some
                lenders feel this is an adequate amount of information to
                determine if a loan should be approved. The advantage for the
                borrower is that it does not count as an inquiry on your credit
                report and thus does not lower your personal credit score.

                How does a broker get paid?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Some brokers will charge a fee up-front for their services and
                then get paid by the lender, as well as when a deal funds.
                Joslen Commercial Funding (JCF) will never charge you, the
                customer, with any fees. We also pay for all shipping. Once a
                loan has been placed and you have received your equipment, the
                lender will pay JCF according to that lender’s referral pay
                schedule.

              </summary>
              <p>
                All loans, Equipment Finance Agreements, or Leases can be paid
                off at any time. Almost all commercial loans, however, are not
                simple interest loans where simple amortization is used, like a
                personal car loan would be. Commercial loans are generally
                contracts for the payments agreed upon and for the term. Most
                lenders will give a discount if a leasee would like to pay early
                for any reason. Many lenders will also let a borrower out of
                their current contract if they desire to upgrade their equipment
                and finance another piece.

              </summary>
              <p>
                Almost every lender defines a “Start-up Business” as being in
                business for 2 years or less. There are some lenders that
                require 3 years. To show that timeframe, I visit the Secretary
                of State's website to see the date that an LLC or Corporation
                was formed. If someone is a sole proprietor doing business as a
                DBA, the lender will require a business license or tax returns
                from a year that would prove the length of time in business.

                Your competitors! Approximately eight out of ten U.S. businesses
                use lease financing to acquire the equipment they need. In
                today's fast-paced business climate, getting the equipment you
                need when you need it is vital to your success. Leasing with

              <p>
                <span>Conservation of Capital</span>
                When capital is conserved by leasing equipment, it can be put
                toward more profitable company uses (increasing inventories,
                expanding sales, etc). The average return on capital for
                business is 18% AFTER taxes.
                <span>Conservation of Credit</span>
                A lease is not a loan. Borrowing reduces lines of credit.
                Leasing is thus a NEW credit source, which allows increased
                borrowing capacity.
                <span>Off Balance Sheet Financing</span>
                Leases may sometimes be treated as off-balance sheet debt, which
                can enhance financial ratios and borrowing capacity.
                <span>Eliminates Obsolescence</span>
                Structured leases can allow upgrade and trade-up options,
                ensuring the latest technology.
                <span>Tax Benefits</span>
                Lease payments can sometimes be treated as a direct expense,
                which allows the equipment to be paid for with pre-tax dollars,
                whereas bank financing only allows expensing the interest costs
                and depreciation.
                <span>Flexible Financing</span>
                Leasing provides fixed rate financing, which specifically
                structures terms to accommodate the needs of each and every
                company. These structured leases include step-up, step-down,
                deferred, and seasonal payment plans.
                <span>So Why Do People Lease?</span>
                Companies lease equipment because leasing represents the best
                use of their financial resources. Businesses, which do not
                lease, operate at a competitive disadvantage. They deny
                themselves the productivity-enhancing effect of newer/better
                equipment. Ultimately, they may lose the ability to compete,
                having higher costs and lower productivity than more
                efficienctly run operations.

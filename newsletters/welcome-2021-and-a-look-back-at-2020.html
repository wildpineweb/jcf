                    <h4>January 2021</h4>
                    <div class="img-header" aria-hidden="true"></div>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>This past year has economically affected businesses in various ways.  Unfortunately the hospitality and other service industries had their set of challenges more than others and moving forward I believe it is important that we support them in every way allowed.  Most of you on this mailing list are contractors, loggers, truck drivers and other essential workers.  Some of you have been slowed by employee challenges, lack of machinery parts etc. but overall your industries have done quite well and 2021 indicators look to be more of the same.</p>
                        <p>For the past few years I have used the first Newsletter of the year to give a sampling of the businesses that we were able to help with their financing needs in the previous year.  Joslen Commercial Funding is proud of it’s reputation in the industry and the services that it can provide with it’s network of dozens of National lenders.</p>
                        <p><strong>Joann D (Lakeworth, Florida)</strong> - A start-up business with a unique set of circumstances.   Owner had industry experience but was involved in her own career.   By hiring experienced people to manage her new construction company,  JCF handled the financing for $50,000 in equipment to keep up with business demand.</p>
                        <p><strong>Daymeon B (View Park, California)</strong> - By purchasing a repossessed truck this experienced driver was able to add an additional truck at a superb price while the lender assured all necessary work will be done.  More hoops to jump through but, the value was certainly there.  JCF keeps track of repossessed vehicles and equipment from many lenders for this reason.</p>
                        <p><strong>Patrick E (Dillion, Colorado)</strong> - Although 2020 found it more difficult to obtain business lines of credit it is still possible.  Patrick was able to access his LOC a number of times when operating capital for his construction company was a challenge.</p>
                        <p><strong>Larry A (Oregon coast)</strong> - Four chip trailers ranging in age from 1970 to 2005 and being sold by a private party  for $28,000.  JCF provided a unique lender that would put all trailers in one contract.  This client has repeatedly come back to JCF to provide for it’s companies growth.  We love our loyal customers!</p>
                        <p><strong>Sawyer J (Coal Center, Pennsylvania)</strong> - At times  buyers need to purchase equipment from different vendors.  This start-up land clearing business needed a skid-steer with mulching head.  JCF coordinated with two different lenders and vendors to provide excellent terms and was able to coordinate funding for both on the same day!</p>
                        <p><strong>Chiropractic Clinic (Vancouver, WA)</strong> - A  working capital loan is often used for expansion,  new employees, new equipment etc.  $100,000 was given to help this clinic with the needs to continue growth.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gamar W (Beaufort, South Carolina)</strong> - Former military and now restaurant owner needed Skid steer to partner with a friend for land clearing services.  Knowing that the goal was to pay off the $40,000 machine quickly, JCF secured financing through a lender with no prepayment penalties.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kevin A (Danville, Indiana)</strong> - Multiple time customer owns landscaping business and needed to add to number of commercial lawn mowers.  Financing was secured with zero buy-out lease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Scott G (Superior, Montana)</strong> - along with partner both had extensive logging experience but desired to start their own logging operation.  Was able to secure exceptional rates for 20 year old Delimber.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anzino D (Ashbury Park, New Jersey)</strong> - long time dump truck driver wanted to reestablish his trucking business after last few years being an employee.  Financing was secured for $42,000 dump truck while and buyer was treated as a long-term business and not a start-up.</p>
                        <p><strong>Leslie S (Friday Harbor, Washington)</strong> - former business owner was able to obtain local contract and needed a Freightliner bucket truck to get his new business underway.  Financing was obtained with one payment up front and sales tax was financed as well.</p>
                        <p>The above examples were chosen for a few different reasons.  I wanted to show various types of financing that Joslen Commercial Funding can provide as well as different industries, equipment and even states.  If you have any question regarding any type of financing or if you are currently looking for terms please be in touch for a free consultation to discuss your situation.  JCF never charges our clients for any consultations, obtaining terms, shipping or banking.</p>
                        <p>Have a great month and a great start to 2021!</p>

                        <h3>Facts About New Year's Resolutions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first New Year’s celebration dates back 4,000 years. Julius Caesar, the emperor of Rome, was the first to declare Jan. 1 a national holiday. He named the month after Janus, the Roman god of doors and gates. Janus had two faces, one looking forward and one looking back. Caesar felt that a month named after this god would be fitting.</li>
                            <li>Forty-five percent of Americans make New Year’s resolutions. The top resolutions are: to lose weight, get organized, to spend less and save more, to stay fit and healthy, and to quit smoking. While nearly half of all Americans make resolutions, 25 percent of them give up on their resolutions by the second week of January.</li>
                            <li>Many people ring in New Year’s by popping open a bottle of champagne. Americans drink close to 360 million glasses of sparkling wine during this time. The bubbly stuff dates back to the 17th century when the cork was invented.</li>
                            <li>According to statistics from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, vehicles are stolen on New Year’s Day more than any other holiday. Don’t think your old car is safe, either. In 2011, the 1994 Honda Accord was the most stolen car. To discourage car theft, make sure your car is in a populated area, and always take your keys.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Just for Laughs!</h2>
                        <p>A shopkeeper was dismayed when a brand new small business much like his own opened up next door and erected a huge sign which read BEST DEALS.</p>
                        <p>He was horrified when another small business competitor opened up on his right, and announced its arrival with an even larger sign, reading LOWEST PRICES.</p>
                        <p>The shopkeeper panicked until he got an idea.</p>
                        <p>He put the biggest sign of all over his own shop.</p>
                        <p>It read MAIN ENTRANCE.</p>

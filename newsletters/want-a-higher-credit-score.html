              <p>
                In previous newsletters, I have written about the myths about
                what affects and does not affect your personal credit score.
                Although there are a number of things that a lender will look at
                before offering commercial financing, a credit score very much
                will play a big part in their decision for approval and rates.
                All lenders have thresh holds with credit score if you are
                anything below a 750. Most commercial buyers are between 550 -
                700 so the difference in rate from 600 to 650 can mean a number
                of more lenders willing to compete for your business. You may be
                surprised how you can raise your score by just paying attention
                to a few small details and getting the ”myths” out of your mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                I encourage all my clients to run a free credit report at
                <a
                  href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"
                  target="_blank"
                  >www.annualcreditreport.com</a
                >. This will show your credit report from all 3 major reporting
                agencies. (Experian, Transunion, and Equifax) You will see
                exactly what a lender is looking at versus a Credit Karma (or
                similar) report which lenders do not consider.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am told almost weekly by a client that they were not aware of
                a collection or past-due account due to having moved or
                sometimes just never being contacted. It is not that difficult
                to monitor and set a goal of 700 or higher to get the best
                possible rates. Pay off any collection accounts that you can. I
                would estimate that 50% of all collection accounts are less than
                $100 but they affect your score greatly. For larger collections
                or past-due work out a payment plan to get them paid off.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also credit repair agencies that will help you get
                derogatory accounts eliminated. If you would like a referral to
                a credit repair company please email or call me.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Below are some of the myths of credit…</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >"Paying off delinquent loans removes it from your credit
                    report"</strong
                  >
                  <p>
                    If you've paid off a delinquent loan or credit card balance,
                    you may think that it's then removed from a credit report
                    and will no longer affect your credit score. Negative
                    information such as late payments, collection accounts, and
                    bankruptcies will remain on a person's credit reports for up
                    to seven years. Certain types of bankruptcies stick around
                    for up to 10 years. Paying off the delinquent account won't
                    remove it from a credit report, but it will update the
                    account to indicate it as “paid”.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >"Canceling credit cards boosts my credit score"</strong
                  >
                  <p>
                    This can often be a popular thing to do for therapeutic
                    reasons but closing an account actually damages your credit
                    score, especially if it's one with long good payment
                    history. Not only does the loss of history affect your score
                    now but the drop in your debt-to-available credit ratio does
                    as well. Sometimes a credit card's annual fee is just a cost
                    of doing business.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"Too many inquiries always hurt"</strong>
                  <p>
                    While a lot of inquiries can certainly drop your score a few
                    points, this fact is largely inflated. Most scoring models
                    actually allow inquiries within a certain time frame to just
                    be considered one inquiry(as far as the score is considered)
                    as the credit bureaus know the inquiries are most likely to
                    be tied to the same loan request. All inquiries fall off
                    after 24 months.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >"Pulling your own credit affects your credit score"</strong
                  >
                  <p>
                    This is absolutely not true. Not only does a consumer have
                    unlimited use of a service such as credit karma and many
                    others, but as mentioned above, every consumer is allowed a
                    complete report from all 3 credit bureaus at
                    <a
                      href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"
                      target="_blank"
                      >www.annualcreditreport.com</a
                    >
                    This is available for no cost on an annual basis and does
                    NOT count as an inquiry. It won't show your score but it
                    will show all accounts that the bureaus are seeing. This
                    allows you to take appropriate action if you see any errors.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >"Paying on time each month results in good credit"</strong
                  >
                  <p>
                    This is another case where a debt utilization ratio comes
                    into play for your credit score. The idea that simply paying
                    your credit card bill on time every month will give you good
                    credit isn't necessarily true. If your
                    <b>utilization is high</b>, then you can have your FICO
                    score drop dramatically. By ratio, I mean if you have a
                    $5000 credit line and you run a balance consistently above
                    $4000 it has a negative effect than if your balance was at
                    $1000. The more available credit on any credit card is a
                    good thing. Credit bureaus and lenders put a lot of weight
                    into ratio utilization.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"You must be in debt to have a good score"</strong>
                  <p>
                    Not true. A key factor that determines your credit score is
                    your debt-to-available credit ratio. If this is too high,
                    your score will drop. Another area that impacts a credit
                    score is not whether you pay the balance off in full each
                    month, but rather consistent on-time monthly payments, As
                    long as you make your payments on time, you can maintain a
                    great score with little to no debt.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"FICO scores are locked in for six months"</strong>
                  <p>
                    Credit scores can change monthly as the creditors update the
                    status of your accounts each month. There's no way to know
                    exactly when in the month the creditors report to the
                    agencies they subscribe to.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"My debit card can't affect my credit"</strong>
                  <p>
                    While a debit card does not report to the credit bureaus, it
                    can help or hurt you if it is tied to an overdraft line of
                    credit. An overdraft line of credit is basically a line of
                    credit that is available in the event that you overdraw your
                    checking account. If you dip below zero, the debit card will
                    still work, but instead of drafting your checking account,
                    it will begin pulling on the line of credit. If you fail to
                    pay on the line of credit (most accounts are auto-paid for
                    at least the minimum due, assuming you have enough money in
                    your checking account by the billing date) or if you use up
                    too much of the available credit, you can hurt your score.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>"A secured credit card helps build credit"</strong>
                  <p>
                    While a secured credit card can possibly help you build
                    credit, it's important to understand how they work and to be
                    aware of their limitations. Secured credit cards are not the
                    same as pre-paid credit cards, which can't help you build
                    credit. Not all secured credit cards report to the credit
                    bureaus, and generally even the ones that don't report to
                    all the bureaus. This is because it costs the creditor money
                    to report to each bureau and, by definition, secured credit
                    cards cater to sub-prime borrowers with low credit limits,
                    which can limit the bank's ability to make money.

                  <p>
                    If you add yourself to someone's loan on an amount large
                    enough to affect your debt-to-income ratio, then you're
                    hurting your credit. If you need your own loan in the
                    future, you may be unable to secure it if your credit shows
                    too many other financial obligations. The lender may or may
                    not accept a letter stating that you do not pay the bill in
                    order to get you qualified, but you're still legally
                    responsible.

              <p>
                I hope the above information is helpful. I encourage anyone who
                sees a window of opportunity to improve your score to seriously
                consider the effort that it takes. The difference in rate for a
                higher credit score can mean thousands of dollars over the
                course of an equipment loan. Those dollars can be used elsewhere
                to grow your business!

              <h3>Endearing Facts about Valentine's Day</h3>

                  <p>
                    The legend of St. Valentine could be attributed to two
                    different men. The first tells of St. Valentine in the third
                    century Rome who defied the current emperor's ban on
                    marriage. The second St. Valentine was killed for attempting
                    to help Christians escape prison in Rome, who supposedly
                    sent the first “valentine'“ message while imprisoned,
                    writing a letter signed “From your Valentine.”

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    While many historians believe that Valentine's Day
                    commemorates the death of St. Valentine on February 14,
                    others suggest that it instead originates from the Pagan
                    fertility festival, “Lupercalia,” which was celebrated on
                    February 15 in ancient Rome.

                    While “St. Valentine's Day” was first declared a holiday by
                    5th century Roman Pope Gelasius, it wasn't until the 14th
                    century that it started becoming associated with love and
                    romance. This was due to the common belief in France and
                    England that birds began their mating season on February 14.

                    While Cupid didn't become a common symbol of Valentine's Day
                    until the 19th century, his roots can be stemmed all the way
                    back to 700 B.C. as the Greek god of love named Eros.
                    However, it was the Romans who adopted Eros a few hundred
                    years later into the image of a boy with a bow and arrow
                    while renaming him “Cupid”.

                    The oldest official record of a valentine being sent was a
                    poem written in 1415 by a French medieval duke named Charles
                    to his wife while incarcerated in the Tower of London at the
                    age of 21 years old. A line of the famed poem reads, “I am
                    already sick of love, My very gentle Valentine.”

                One day, a third grade student came to class wearing a Fitbit
                watch. The teacher proceeded to ask the student, “Are you
                tracking your steps?”
              </p>
              <p>
                “No,” said the little girl. “I wear this for Mommy so she can
                show Daddy when he gets home.”

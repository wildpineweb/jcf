              <p>
                Before I process an application for commercial credit i am often
                asked whether I do a 'hard' credit pull or a 'soft' credit pull.
                We all know that a hard pull show as an inquiry on your credit
                report while a soft one does not, but it is commonly
                misunderstood why one is done over the other or vice versa.
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">What is a hard credit pull?</h5>
              <p>
                When you apply for a new credit card, mortgage, or other type of
                loan, the lender will do a hard pull on your credit. This means
                they will access your full credit report for the purpose of
                making a lending decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a hard inquiry is submitted, your credit score will
                generally drop by a few points, though multiple hard inquiries
                in a short period of time may cause it to drop further. A hard
                inquiry will stay on your report for up to two years, though the
                impact will diminish over time. Without a hard inquiry, a lender
                will not be able to extend an offer of credit to you.
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">What is a soft credit pull?</h5>
              <p>
                A soft credit pull, or soft inquiry, does not affect your credit
                score. Your full credit report is not released in a soft
                inquiry, though some information is disclosed.
              </p>
              <p>A soft inquiry may be made when:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You check your own credit report</li>
                <li>

                    >preapproval with a credit card</a
                  >
                  or mortgage
                </li>
                <li>You apply for an apartment rental</li>
                <li>An insurance company does an account review</li>
              </ul>
              <h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">
                What's the difference between a hard pull and a soft pull?
              </h5>
              <p>
                A hard credit pull accesses your full credit report. The lender
                will have access to your full credit history, and the pull
                itself will be noted in your credit file for future lenders to
                observe. Meanwhile, a soft pull doesn't give the full picture --
                but it also doesn't affect your credit. For the most part, you
                need to personally authorize a hard credit pull, but not much
                information is needed about you for a soft pull to be run.
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">
                How much do hard inquiries hurt your credit score?
              </h5>
              <p>
                A hard credit inquiry can decrease your credit score by up to
                five points,
                <a
                  href="https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-reports/credit-checks-and-inquiries"
                  target="_blank"
                  >according to FICO</a
                >, (FICO is an independent data analytics company and not a
                credit bureau) though it may less impact if you have good or
                excellent credit. And while a hard inquiry will remain on your
                credit report for up to two years, your score is usually only
                impacted for a year or less.
              </p>
              <p>
                The type of inquiry matters.
                <strong
                  ><em
                    >If you're rate shopping for a mortgage or loan, FICO will
                    ignore credit inquires for 30 days prior to adjusting your
                    score.</em
                  ></strong
                >
                If you're applying for a new credit card, however, it's best to
                avoid triggering multiple hard inquiries in a short period of
                time. Too many inquiries could suggest you are a risky borrower
                who is more likely to default. And multiple inquiries in a short
                period of time can lead to a lower score and applications being
                denied.
              </p>
              <h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">
                How can you reduce the impact of a hard inquiry?
              </h5>
              <p>
                First, know where your credit score stands. Federal law
                guarantees that you can check your credit reports for free every
                12 months, and
                <a

                  target="_blank"
                  >the three major credit bureaus upped that to once per week</a

                  >annualcreditreport.com</a
                >
                to view your reports from each of the three credit bureaus. You
                can reduce the impact of hard inquiries by following these
                guidelines:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Apply strategically.</strong> Space out your
                  applications and make use of prequalification.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Apply selectively.</strong> Calibrate your
                  applications and credit score; there's a risk in applying for
                  a card that requires excellent credit if you have a lower
                  score. When possible, check to see if you prequalify for a
                  card you're interested in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Practice good credit habits.</strong> Good credit
                  habits go a long way in keeping your credit score healthy. Pay
                  your bills on time and in full and monitor your credit.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>In summary:</strong> Being educated about your credit
                and how the three main bureaus determine your credit score is
                imperative to efficiently run your business. The small amount of
                time it takes to monitor your credit and dispute anything that
                does not look correct is a small price to pay to ensure that you
                are able to obtain the best possible rate for your loan.

                A man and his adult son were about to pay for their meal at a
                restaurant when the man realized he had left his wallet in his
                truck. Before heading out the door to grab it, he explained to
                the waitress the situation, and said with a grin, “But don't
                worry, I'm leaving my son for collateral.”

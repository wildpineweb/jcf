                    <h4>January 2022</h4>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>For the past few years, I have used the first Newsletter of the year to give a sample of the businesses that we were able to help with their financing needs for the year ending.</p>
                        <p>In spite of 2021 proving to be a challenging year in a number of ways, Joslen Commercial Funding was still able to help dozens of small business owners finance the equipment and trucks they needed.   It was not the economy that slowed down purchasing but the lack of inventory due to a shortage of parts, layoffs at assembly lines etc.  JCF is proud of its reputation in the commercial financing industry and the services that it can provide with its network of dozens of National lenders.  It is this reputation that sends referrals and repeat customers our way.</p>
                        <p><b>Below are some examples of the help we were able to give and what makes JCF a unique commercial lending firm.</b></p>
                        <p><b>Jose V (New Castle CO)</b><br>This client was starting a new excavation and foundation company.  JCF noticed that although this was a new venture, the client had filed his LLC 3 years previous.  This allowed us to take advantage of a longer TIB (time in business) which allowed the customer single-digit rates which is extraordinarily rare for a borrower in this situation.  Needless to say the customer was ecstatic.</p>

                    <h1><a href="what-is-irs-code-section-179.html">IRS Code Section 179 | What is it - in Simple Terms?</a></h1>
                    <h4>December 2021</h4>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>This time of year, I am inundated with emails from lenders proclaiming, “Make sure your clients are taking advantage of Section 179!” In short, Section 179 allows a business deduction in the year that you put a piece of equipment in use. Although I have spoken of Section 179 in the past, I have put together a short bullet presentation for easy reading and understanding.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Section 179 is designed to make purchasing/leasing that equipment during this calendar year financially attractive.</li>
                            <li>Almost all types of “business equipment” that your company buys or finances will qualify for the Section 179 deduction. This includes office furniture and some personal vehicles.</li>
                            <li>Lease payments are deductible in addition to the depreciation.</li>
                            <li>Section 179 began in 2008 to help stimulate the economy. The deduction has caught on and in 2015 became permanent under the IRS PATH Act passed by congress.</li>
                            <li>Section 179 allows you to depreciate 100% of the equipment purchased in the current calendar year.</li>

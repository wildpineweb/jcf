                    <h4>May 2022</h4>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>Joslen Commercial Funding LLC (JCF) is proud of its history and the number of small business owners that they have been able to help with their commercial financing needs. Oftentimes, I am asked if JCF is a "direct lender", to which I respond, “No, but are you looking for one?” Once I help them understand the services offered by a direct lender compared to the services and benefits that are offered by a specialist broker (such as JCF!), the light seems to come on for them.</p>
                        <p>Commercial lending is a huge industry and exists because relationship lending with credit unions and local banks is becoming progressively scarcer. While JCF works primarily with companies who need financing for business-essential equipment and working capital loans, we have additionally created partnerships for SBA loans, factoring specialists, real estate financing for all credit tiers, etc. The industry works within an undefined, tight network of professionals who recognize the specialties and abilities of other agencies.</p>
                        <p><b>But more specifically, what can JCF offer you?</b></p></p>

                    <h4>April 2022</h4>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>In previous newsletters, I have written about the myths about what affects and does not affect your personal credit score. Although there are a number of things that a lender will look at before offering commercial financing, a credit score very much plays a big part in their decision for approval and rates. All lenders have thresholds with credit score if you are anything below 750. Most commercial buyers are between 550 - 700, so the difference in rate between 600 to 650 could mean a number of more lenders willing to compete for your business. You may be surprised how much you can raise your score by just paying attention to a few small details and paying less attention to the "myths" about credit score that are out there.</p>

                    <h4>March 2022</h4>
                    <div class="news-content">
                        <p>Those who have obtained Small Business Administration loans often have the same consensus on the process and results. Whereas an SBA loan can certainly offer some attractive terms for a small business, the qualifications to obtain and the time it takes to secure one of these loans can be frustrating for the borrower. SBA loans and the application process can be cumbersome and it takes a specialist to deal with the idiosyncrasies of the 12 different SBA programs available.</p>
                        <p>Joslen Commercial Funding has recently partnered with a leader in this specialized field to expand the services we can provide for our customers.  What makes this partnership unique is that the principals spent years at a conventional bank (Wells Fargo) processing SBA loans resulting in a complete understanding of the SBA underwriting processes. In the many years since they created their own company only two times have they given conditional approval to a borrower and not had the loan come to fruition. These types of results are invaluable as it keeps borrowers from jumping through the many hoops required only to ultimately get turned down.</p>
